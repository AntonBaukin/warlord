      <h3>About WARLord Skeleton Project</h3>
    
      <p>
        I've created <a href = 'https://github.com/AntonBaukin/embeddy'
        target = '_blank'>Embeddy</a> OSGi application skeleton that packs in
        standalone JAR file OSGi application and all it's bundles, integrates Spring
        Framework 4 MVC with OSGi HTTP Service provided by embedded Jetty server, and
        applies Nashorn JavaScript engine to server-side scripting on the base of
        ZeT JS library — JsX facility.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href = 'https://github.com/AntonBaukin/embeddy' target = '_blank'>WARLord</a>
        skeleton is much simpler as it's ordinary WAR application to run in standard
        Java servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat, or in an application server.
        In includes the same core components as Embeddy.

      <p>
        This sample web application is simple in nature, but the implementation
        has no brute simplifications. There are Employees working in Departments,
        related N-to-1, and 1-to-1: department has a head that is one of it's
        employees. Data are stored in single table in document-oriented form.
        Each object has one or more projections that are merged by web controllers
        to represent object as a whole document. Web UI is a single page application
        on Angular JS framework with my favourite Anger module. Spring MVC connects
        the web with the backend. Data access is with plain SQL — I've retired from
        ORM to documents and related projections.
